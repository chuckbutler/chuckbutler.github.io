#### Jan 30'th 2015 -  FLOSS Community Metrics

**Measurements for success - Building a community around Juju**

Building a community around juju involves traversing many firewalls, infrastructure barriers, and false positives. To gain deeper insight into our user adoption without going into an opt-in/opt-out model we have been evaluating some of our base machine metrics to find key performance indicators about our community. As we look to 2015 with these metrics, we're finding finer grained data points to drill down and derive more insights out of existing data and newer points to define success.

####  June 19'th 2014 - USENIX Configuration Management Summit

**Automating Orchestration in the Cloud with Ubuntu Juju** Most of you have automated your deployments. But how does it stand up to the bus factor? How reusable is your automation solution? Do you find yourself wrestling more with the annoyances of scaling than deploying your actual services?

Service orchestration is now the easiest, most flexible, and most approachable solution to shipping your infrastructure woes to /dev/null. Starting with Ubuntuâ€™s 14.04 LTS release, our suite of devops tools are baked right into the base Ubuntu Server installation.

In this session, we'll quickly go over the basic concepts of Juju and spend the rest of the time walking through explicit examples of Juju in action. We'll look at stacks of services managed by Juju and the charms behind those services.

We'll talk about how to get you up and running quickly with multi-sharded MongoDB clusters, Hadoop, Cassandra, and more in just a few commands. All ready to be deployed and reused to meet your needs.

#### March 8'th 2014 - Western Pennsylvania Linux User Group
**Automating Orchestration in the Cloud with Ubuntu Juju**

Do you use a tool like Puppet or Chef to configure and deploy software
on multiple machines?  Juju takes this to the next level by defining
things in terms of services, not packages.  It orchestrates the
multiple pieces of software which must interact--such as a content
management system, web server, and database--to deliver a particular
service.
