The first trip in 2015 was a real monster of a conference circuit. I was given 3 weeks notice that I had to prepare for
the largest FLOSS conference in Belgium - FOSDEM. This was my first interaction with any European organization that comes
together in the name of Free as in Libre software. I have to admit that the entire experience was way beyond anything I
had expected. The culture surrounding Free Software in Europe appears to be much greater than anything in the US.

## FOSDEM

FOSDEM was a gathering of over 5,000 hackers - both project contributors and fans consuming the software, at the university
de libre in Brussels. With tracks covering nearly every aspect imaginable in the field:

- Programming
- Network Security / Infosec
- Licensing and Legal
- Web standards
- Configuration Management

Just to name a few of the larger topic tracks. I attended several talks and was literally blown away by the raw passion
of this meeting. Every single hacker there had the spark in their eye of 'this is where I belong'.

When I took the stage on Saturday to deliver the introduction to Juju talk, I was fairly apprehensive as this was the largest
crowd I had ever spoken in front of. Not something I took very lightly. However in typical LazyPower fashion I burnt through
my slides in just under 20 minutes, and spent the remainder of the hour answering questions about the concepts of service
orchestration to a crowd that was still very much focused on Configuration Management. What really delighted me is one member
approached me after the fact and stated "Juju is deceptively simple in how it presents orchestration, and is easily confused
with configuration management"

This excited me to no end, that one person truly grokked what I was trying to explain in so many words.
