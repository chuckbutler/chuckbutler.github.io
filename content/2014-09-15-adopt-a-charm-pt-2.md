In [Part 1](/adopt-a-charm) of the Adopt a Charm series we covered:

- Picking a charm
- Ensuring we are the sole maintainer
- Triaging the issue listing
- Applying very minimal cosmetic cleanup of an 'abandoned' project

Now we're ready to take a look at the next steps of the process. Namely how we can bring the charm up in terms of relevance, and ensuring we are providing a great user experience with Juju.
